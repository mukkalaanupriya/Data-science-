The project involved several key stages, including data collection, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and the development of machine learning models for predictive analytics. Additionally, I implemented data visualization techniques using Python libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to present insights effectively. This experience provided me with valuable hands-on knowledge in data science, enabling me to apply theoretical concepts to real-world challenges and hone my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and visualization.
